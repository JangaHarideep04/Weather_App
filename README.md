# Weather_App


The weather app is a simple web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data based on user input for a specific city. Here's a brief summary:

HTML Structure: The HTML file defines the structure of the webpage, including a form for user input, a card for displaying weather information, and various elements for temperature, city name, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon.

CSS Styling: The CSS file enhances the visual appeal of the app by providing styles for the card, search bar, and weather details.

JavaScript Functionality: The JavaScript code handles the dynamic aspects of the app. It makes asynchronous API calls to OpenWeatherMap, retrieves weather data, and updates the DOM with the information. The weather icon is dynamically changed based on current weather conditions.

OpenWeatherMap API: The app relies on the OpenWeatherMap API to obtain real-time weather details for a specified city. An API key is used for authentication.

User Interaction: Users can input a city name, click the search button, and receive weather information for that city. The default city is set to "New York," and weather details are displayed upon loading.

Improvements: The code can be enhanced by incorporating additional error handling, improving the user interface, and adding features like multi-day forecasts or more detailed weather information.

This weather app provides a basic foundation for understanding how to integrate APIs, fetch data asynchronously, and update the user interface dynamically based on the received information. Further development can include adding more features and refining the user experience.
